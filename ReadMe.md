<h1>CS 152 Final Project Documentation</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>  The program will launch a UI that will take in 2 card hands from the user. After clicking the "compare" button, the program will return the values ofthe hands and tell the user which hand wins.

The implementation of the hand evaluation logic is in functional and pseudo-functional python.

<h2> Setup Instructions </h2>

1. Install the PySimpleGUI library using :  ```pip install PySimpleGUI```     

2. Run the ```poker_gui.py``` file. 

```poker_functional.py``` contains the logic for all the evaluations.
```poker_imperative.py``` contains the same logic, but in imperative programming. This file is only for reference, and the funtions within it are never called.
